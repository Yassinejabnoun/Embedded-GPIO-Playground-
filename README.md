# Embedded GPIO Playground ðŸš¦

This project demonstrates practical usage of **GPIOs** (General Purpose Input/Output) 
on an STM32 microcontroller. Using buttons and LEDs, we implement fundamental concepts such as 
**debouncing**, **bit operations**, **timers**, and **state control**.

The project was originally inspired by a lab exercise, but it has been further developed 
and documented here as a standalone project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **LED Toggle**: Toggle LEDs on/off by pressing a button.
- **Software Debouncing**: Debounce buttons using a `CDebouncer` class.
- **Chasing Light**: Sequential running light across LEDs (different timer strategies).
- **Configurable Light**: Adjust direction and speed of the light using buttons.
- **Timer Class**: Manage waiting times flexibly without using blocking `sleep`.

## ðŸ›  Hardware Setup

- STM32 Nucleo board (e.g. STM32F4xx or similar)  
- Breadboard with:
  - 8 LEDs + resistors
  - 8 push buttons
- USB Logic Analyzer (e.g. used with **PulseView**)

---

## ðŸ’» Software Setup

- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)  
- Mbed OS project structure  
- PulseView for logic analysis
